I ask my friend<br />
Hey! Which do you like better?<br />
But the answer is already decided on my head<br />

I ask my friend<br />
Hey! Which do you like better?<br />
But the answer is already decided on my head<br />

I hate to decide on it<br />
'cuz it's a small thing<br />

I hate to decide on it<br />
'cuz it's a small thing<br />

Troubled! Troubled! Troubled!<br />
I'm so indecisive<br />
Whenever I buy clothes and buy shoes<br />

Troubled! Troubled! Troubled!<br />
I'm so indecisive<br />
Whenever I buy bug and buy accesories<br />

I ask my boyfriend<br />
Hey! Which do I look better?<br />
But the answer is already decided on my head<br />

I hate to decide on it<br />

Troubled! Troubled! Troubled!<br />
I'm so indecisive<br />

I'm sick of Me<br />
I'm tired of Me<br />
I'm sick of Me<br />
I'm tired of Me<br />
