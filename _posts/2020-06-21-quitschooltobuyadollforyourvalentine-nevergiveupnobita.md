i'm not sure that i care about this day<br />
'till you would share your day to get along<br />
glad, confused and unprepared fucked me up<br />
but i don't wanna wasted an invitation to get closer with you<br />
with you<br />

i don't give you a chocolate 'cause it can make you fat<br />
i don't give you a flower 'cause i hate to bring it<br />
but i give you a sweety pink pig doll with flower tattoo on his ass<br />

hug it as you wanna hug me<br />
give it zwitsal make it feels like baby<br />
named it by my name and don't hate it<br />
'cause i quit school to buy a doll for my valentine!<br />

i don't give you a chocolate 'cause it can make you fat<br />
i don't give you a flower 'cause i hate to bring it<br />
but i give you a sweety pink pig doll with flower tattoo on his ass<br />

i wondering if i were Sid so you are my Nancy<br />
i know i gave nothing but i didn't lose a moment<br />
i'm not sure that i care about this day<br />
but i care 'bout me and you!<br />
